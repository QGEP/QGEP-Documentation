Introduction
============

`Wincan 2 QGEP <https://github.com/QGEP/qgis_wincan2qgep>`_ is a QGIS plugin to import inspection data from Wincan to QGEP.
It currently works with Wincan 8 format only, but it is planned to upgrade it to support Wincan VX and/or pure `VSA-DSS <https://www.vsa.ch/en/fachbereiche-cc/siedlungsentwaesserung/vsa-dss/datenmodell/>`_ KEK format.

It can be seen a matching procedure between the inspection TV data and the network data.

The plugin will read the XML file from the data and offer an interface to search and select on map the corresponding channels from the inspection data.
Once this matching achieved, data can be imported within QGEP.
