Digitizing detailed geometry
============================

General
-------------------------

You can add a detailed geometry to waste water structures. This is recommended in the following cases:
* For special structures and infiltration points, because they are not normed structures like manholes, where you can definie dimension1 and 2 to describe the extension.
* For infiltration installations where dimension1 and 2 are not enough to describe the geometry
* Important: Detailed geometry is usually not used for manholes or channels!



Digitizing tool
-------------------------

* Select the vw_qgep_cover layer
* Select the object where you want to add a detailed geometry with the info tool
* Right click the object and select the vw_qgep_cover layer
* Choose "Digitize"
