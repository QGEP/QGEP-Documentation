.. _Execute:

SWMM Execute
============


QGEP plugin
-----------

The path to the SWMM executable must be set in the Processsing tools options.

Launch ``SWMM Execute``:

- ``INP file``: the ``.inp`` file generated during the previous step
- ``LOG file``: a log file generated by swmm, contains the errors.

.. _Common-Import-Errors:

Common import errors
--------------------

``Undefined Node``: The node doesn't exist in junctions, outfalls, dividers, storages

``Undefined Link``: The link doesn't exist in conduits, pumps, orifices, weirs, outlets

You have to solve the errors in the order in which they appear in the report. Some errors are interrelated (i.e. a node in a conduit is not defined => the conduit is not imported => Undefined link error)

Common running errors
---------------------
The list of errors can be found `here <https://swmm5.org/2016/09/05/swmm-5-1-and-infoswmm-error-and-warning-messages/>`_

- ``ERROR 211: invalid number -XXX at line XXX of [JUNC] section:``: A negative number is provided for the depth. Change the value in QGEP or in the ``.inp`` file.

Python command line
-------------------
Advanced users might want to run the scripts directly from Python. 

.. code :: python

	from .QgepSwmm import QgepSwmm
	INPFILE = 'C:\\qgep_swmm\\input\\qgep_swmm.inp'
	OUTFILE = 'C:\\qgep_swmm\\output\\swmm.out'
	LOGFILE = 'C:\\qgep_swmm\\output\\log.out'
	qs = qgep_swmm(None, INPFILE, None, OUTFILE, LOGFILE, None, None)
	qs.execute_swmm()
