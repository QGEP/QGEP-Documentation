Data entry
==========

There are basically two ways:

* Data entry by constructing or digitizing in the QGEP GIS itself
* Data entry in an external programm or software and then importing the position and/or technical data into QGEP e.g.:

   * coordinates from manholes from measurement
   * position and/or technical data from another GIS or CAD system
   * using data from the surveyor (e.g. property boundaries) as a basis for defining catchment borders
   * other

Data entry in QGEP needs some understanding of the underlaying data model `VSA-DSS <http://dss.vsa.ch>`_, but is supported with some great data collecting wizards and forms that link the different tables correctly together. Especially the linking of manholes and reaches to a complete sewer network is highly automated and can be controlled with the network following tool.


General
-------
When digitzing you start with the point elements (wastewater structures such as manholes, special structures). Then you can connect those with line elements (channels with reaches).

To start with data entry select the QGEP button **Wizzard**.
