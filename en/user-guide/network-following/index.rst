Network following tools
=======================

This represents a guide on how to use the network following tools in QGEP.


Upstream
--------

* It does not matter, which layer is selected

* Be sure, that your network topology is updated (if not sure, use the **refresh network topology** tool first).

* To start upstream network following select the **Upstream** QGEP button

* QGEP opens then profile window at the bottom of the map. Click on your start node. 

* If there is more than one node in this area, you choose the one you want form the list

* After a few seconds all upstream reaches will be highlighted and you can see where the water is coming from.

* If you want to select the highlighted reaches, then klick on the **Select current path** button in the profile window

* You can now work with your reach selection in the attribute table or zoom to the selected reaches (if the vw_qgep_reach layer is selected)

* Use this tool to check if the topology of your network is correct.


Downstream
----------

* Downstream network following works similar as the Upstream network following described above.

* You can see where the water is going to. 

* Control, if QGEP finds also the overflows

* Use this to check whether the topology of your network is correct or to find out where you could intervene in case of an accident.
