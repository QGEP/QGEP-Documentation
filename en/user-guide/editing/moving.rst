Moving Wastewater Structures with Reaches, Covers and Nodes
===========================================================

This represents a guide on how to move covers with reaches and wastewater nodes compared to just moving the cover in QGEP.

General
------------

It's not unusual, that manholes are digitized the first time with low precision. Later the manholes are measured, and there is the need, to move the whole wastewater structure (means cover, node and reachpoints of all reaches) to the measuered point.

How to
------------

* Select the **vw_qgep_wastewater_structure** layer
* Set the layer to edit mode.
* Select the **Move Feature** tool (standard QGIS tool in the advanced digitizing toolbar)

.. figure:: 

* Left Click one the wastewater_structure you want to move and left click again at the new place
* This feature allows to move the whole manhole or special structure with all the connected reaches and wastewater nodes.
* In comparison you can also only move the cover or the wastewater node
