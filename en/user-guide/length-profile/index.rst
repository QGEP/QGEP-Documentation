Then select a next manhole - it is not needed to be the direct next one. The tool automatically selects the manholes in between. You can repeat this several times. If there is no continuity you will get a warning. Right click to finish your selection.

In the profile window you now have the length profile. You can see detail info about manholes. When hovering, you can see with a green highlighting the manhole you currently touch.
